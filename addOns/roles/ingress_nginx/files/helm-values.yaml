# Deploy the ingress controller to the master node, using the host network
#   This is achieved by using a nodeSelector and toleration of the node-role/master taint
# This means that we can expose the cluster just by exposing the master node
# Make sure to use the RollingUpdate update strategy
# Set minAvailable to 0 for the controller and the default backend as not
# doing so would prevent us from draining the master for maintenance
